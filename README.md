# Perceptron

## What is Perceptron
The Perceptron is a machine learning algorithm used for binary classification. The algorithm is based on a linear model where the input is transformed into a linear combination of the weights and bias. If the linear combination is greater than a threshold, the perceptron outputs a 1, otherwise it outputs a 0. The perceptron is trained using a training set of data where the correct output is known. The weights and bias are updated after each training example is presented until the perceptron converges on a solution.
